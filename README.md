# TeamWorkOps
This CLI application has been created so that managers can generate a webpage with employee information that is summarized for each person. This information includes their email, GitHub profile, role, department, office number, and school (if they are an intern). This webpage will format a team roster where a manager can quickly email an employee or access their GitHub profile.
